## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) - Font family

### What I learned

In this project, I improved my skills using Tailwind CSS for responsive design and flexbox layout. I also focused on implementing hover and focus states efficiently with Tailwind's utility classes.

Here is an example of the button hover effect I implemented:

```css
@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Inter:wght@400;600;700&display=swap');

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;


@layer components {
    button {
        @apply flex flex-row justify-center p-3 font-bold leading-[150%] rounded-lg text-white bg-gray-700 w-full;
    }

    button:hover {
        @apply text-gray-700 bg-primary;
    }
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to dive deeper into advanced Tailwind CSS utilities and improve my proficiency with custom configurations. I also want to explore more accessibility features for better user experiences.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - The official documentation helped me understand how to effectively use the utility-first approach.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) - This platform provides great challenges to practice real-world scenarios in front-end development.
